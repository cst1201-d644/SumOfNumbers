# SumOfNumbers
Calculate a sum of numbers.

Write a program that asks the user for a positive nonzero integer value. The program should use a loop to get the sum of all the integers from 1 up to the number entered. For example, if the user enters 50, the loop will find the sum of 1, 2, 3, 4, ... 50.
